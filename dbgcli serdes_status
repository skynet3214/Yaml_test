dbgcli serdes_status 
dbg_printf comes from 
uif_dbgcli.c
introducing a new api in the libdbgcli so that the caller if they want to generate the output in a key value pair, it is an functionality. 
whoever wants to dump it 

-- modify the current debugdump, write a couple of function that can just generate the yaml compatible versions for each command as they are passed by and written to a file just like debugdump. 


dbgcli - all commands are the same level. try to make it more cateogrised, and have automatic completion. 

define a hierarchy and say what functionality needs to be executed at the end of the 

parser is a part of infra, 

write files with macro, that defines the hierarchy. 

build a yaml web service . 


x="dbgcli -s mcp -q -e uif 0"
#echo $($x)
a=$($x)
echo "$a" > tst

 while IFS= read -r line
           do
echo $line ...
done < tst

#while read i;
#do echo "$i";
#done < $a
